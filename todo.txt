Things to not forget
  
  BUGS:
	
	localization!
	
	if it is a unix link resolve the link
	
	parsing of gitignore is not really looking for gitignore rules, it looks for file paths instead of the "gitignored expressions"
	
	On windows there is a problem of encoding on some UTF8 path names.
	
  TODO:
	
	add/edit/list branches
	add/edit/list tags
	
	easy switch
	easy merge
	
	stash
	
	allow to minimize the commit dialog..
  
  	When switching places path, call to "iconsUpdateCall" quickly to show instant icons instead of waiting for the time interval
